# Adafruit_GFX_modified
This is a modified version of Adafruit_GFX library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library written by Limor Fried/Ladyada for Adafruit Industries.
This library contains a new function fillRectAny that allows the creation of rectangle in any orientation. I created this function for my project : http://www.instructables.com/id/Chronobot-A-clever-alarm-clock/.

To download, click the DOWNLOAD ZIP button, uncompress and rename the uncompressed folder Adafruit_GFX_modified. Confirm that the Adafruit_GFX_modified folder contains Adafruit_GFX.cpp and Adafruit_GFX.h

Place the Adafruit_GFX_modified library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/Libraries/ folder. You may need to create the Libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
