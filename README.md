# Adafruit_GFX_modified
This is a modified version of Adafruit_GFX library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library. This library contains a new function fillRectAny that allows the creation of rectangle in any orientation. I created this function for my project : http://www.instructables.com/id/Chronobot-A-clever-alarm-clock/.
